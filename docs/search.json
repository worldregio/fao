The data are related to the year 2022, but it is possible to study time series back to 1961 under certain conditions (change in country borders, evolution of FAO nomenclature, etc.). It is alos possible to change the criteria of measurement, the graph of proximity, …"

We keep small island states which will oblige us to choose a weight matrix different from classicall measure based on border contiguity.\n\n\nGeopolitical network\nAs discussed in another part of the WorlRegio project (see. here)[https://worldregio.github.io/world_geom/geopolitical_network.html], thay are plenty of solutions for the elaboration of a network of proximity between states (i.e. a weight matrix that will be used as constraint in the clustering algorithm).\nWe choose here a method of Voronoï-Delaunay triangulation on map where we have used a polar projection on the North\n\n\n\n\n\nAs you can see, all states are connected, eventually at long distance as we can see in the example of the link between Canada and Korea or French Polynesia and Chile.\nThis solution is without any doubt likely to be criticized because it depends on the projection, on the choice of the center of states adopted, on the fact to keep or eliminate small states, etc. But our purpose is mainly pedagogical here and it is not the time to discuss the choice of the best geopolitical network. Just keep in mind that this choice has important implications on the results.\n\n\nDissimilarity matrix\nWe begin directly with the case of a dissimilarity matrix using all 95 items proposed by the FAO to describe a country’s diet. The table is of the following form. The unit of measurement is Kcal per person per day.\n\n\n\nDonnées

code of products will probably look very abstract for the reader but you can find more detailed explication on FAO website\nTo measure the dissimilarity between two countries, we decide to use the Whittaker distance measure, which is the sum of the absolute values of the percentage differences divided by 2 :\n\\(D_{ij} = \\frac{1}{2}\\sum_{k=1}^K |\\frac{x_{ik}}{x_{i.}}-\\frac{x_{jk}}{x_{j.}}|\\)\nCalculation is very easy with the dist.ldc function of the package adespatial, which is optimized for calculation on large arrays (which is not the case here).\n\n\nInfo -- For this coefficient, sqrt(D) would be Euclidean\n\n\n\nExtrait de la matrice de

in the case of the geopolitical network, the choice of the dissimilarity matrix is likely to be criticized because they are many possible options that could obviously produce different results. We could firstly choose another measuer of dissimilarity (many of them are presented and discussed in Guénard and Legendre (2022)). But we could also decide to use a different weight for the measure of the role of the 95 food items. Instead of Kcal/, we could have simply use the Kg/capita. Another option could be to focus on proteins or fat present in each item. In this cases some items would have an increase or decrease of their influence in the elaboration of dissimilarity. Last but not least, the level of disaggregation of food items would modify the results (consider the case of oils …)."

    "text": "Classification\nHaving defined the weight matrix and the dissimilarity matrix, we can move on to classification, which is carried out using the constr.hclust() function from the adespatial package, whose instructions for use are nicely described in Guénard and Legendre (2022) with an example.\n\nTree\nAs in a classical hierarchical classification, we have to analyse the tree before to take a decision on the number of regions we want to build.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe choice is not obvious but we can start with a division in 6 classes\n\n\nNetwork visualization of regions\nThe adespatial package allows us to visualize the result in the form of a graph. The borders of the corresponding countries are superimposed on the graph.\n\n\n\n\n\nOne of the most interesting results of this example if the fact that the regions obtained does not necessarily follow the usual limits of continents, precisely because we have selected a Voronoï-Delaunay network that made possible links at long distance. Two examples can illustrate this point :\n\nThe region represented in gray associates Europe (including Russia), USA, Canada, Chile, Argentina, Uruguay, Australia and New-Zealand, creating a very good approximation of the so-called “Global North” or “Western”. This result was possible only because of the long distance links creating by the Voronoï-Delaunay network across the Pacific through the … territory of French Polynesia. Should we have eliminated this entity, such a region would not have come to existence !\nThe region represented in blue is associated to the majority of muslim countries and associate Northern Africa with Middle East, Central Asia and part of the Indian Ocean. Huntington’s fan would probably interpret this result through the lenz of religion (e.g. the fact that alcohol is forbidden) but it is not perfectly true because many other products contribute to the result as we will see below. And as in the previous case, the result is strongly dependent from the geopolitical network adopted.\n\nTo summarize : this example illustrate that regionalizations of the world based on a criterium of homogeneity are always a compromise between the choice of the geopolitical network used as weight matrix and the choice of the dissimilarity measure. The big danger from scientific point of view is to consider that only one factor is at stake when both are clearly combined.\n\n\nSpecificities of region\nWe use the catdes() function from the FactoMineR package to analyze class profiles.\n\n\n\nSpecificities of the regions in terms of energy supply measured in Kcal)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnder-représentation (z-score &lt; -3)\nOver-représentation (z-score &gt; +3)\n\n\n\n\nReg. 1\nBeer, Pigmeat\nWheat and products, Dates, Mutton & Goat Meat, Tomatoes and products, Onions, Nuts and products, Maize Germ Oil, Olives (including preserved)\n\n\nReg. 2\nSoyabean Oil; Lemons, Limes and products; Grapes and products (excl wine); Oats; Beer; Fruits, other; Sunflowerseed Oil; Cocoa Beans and products; Vegetables, other; Oilcrops Oil, Other; Beverages, Alcoholic; Sweeteners, Other; Nuts and products; Fats, Animals, Raw; Butter, Ghee; Pigmeat; Oranges, Mandarines; Apples and products; Potatoes and products; Poultry Meat; Milk - Excluding Butter; Eggs; Sugar (Raw Equivalent); Wheat and products\nGroundnuts; Cassava and products; Sorghum and products; Groundnut Oil; Oilcrops, Other; Yams; Millet and products; Sesame seed; Beverages, Fermented; Plantains; Palm Oil; Palmkernel Oil; Pulses, Other and products\n\n\nReg. 3\nPulses, Other and products, Cassava and products, Maize and products, Palm Oil, Rice and products\nMilk - Excluding Butter, Wine, Beer, Pigmeat, Butter, Ghee, Potatoes and products, Honey, Fats, Animals, Raw, Sunflowerseed Oil, Apples and products, Cream, Cocoa Beans and products, Rye and products, Oilcrops Oil, Other, Oats, Eggs, Nuts and products, Wheat and products, Sweeteners, Other, Rape and Mustard Oil, Grapes and products (excl wine), Olive Oil, Bovine Meat, Demersal Fish, Beverages, Alcoholic, Sugar (Raw Equivalent), Coffee and products, Tomatoes and products, Oranges, Mandarines\n\n\nReg. 4\nSunflowerseed Oil; Nuts and products\nPineapples and products; Poultry Meat; Soyabean Oil; Oranges, Mandarines; Lemons, Limes and products; Infant food; Sugar (Raw Equivalent); Grapefruit and products; Fruits, other; Maize and products\n\n\nReg. 5\nTomatoes and products; Wheat and products\nRice and products; Freshwater Fish; Ricebran Oil; Sugar cane; Pimento; Palmkernel Oil\n\n\nReg. 6\nVegetables, other, Poultry Meat, Eggs\nMaize and products, Beverages, Fermented\n\n\nReg. 7\nMilk - Excluding Butter\nCoconuts - Incl Copra; Coconut Oil; Aquatic Animals, Others; Molluscs, Other; Marine Fish, Other; Roots, Other; Aquatic Plants; Pelagic Fish; Pigmeat; Sweet potatoes; Soyabeans; Miscellaneous; Poultry Meat; Vegetables, other; Cephalopods; Crustaceans\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinal map"

The level of consumption of Africa is at index 86 i.e -14% lower than the world average. On the contrary, Europe is at index 116 which is +16% higher than the world average.

We can reveal more important inequalities with a lowest level of 76 (-24% of world average) in Eastern Africa and an highest level of 130 (+30% of world average) in Northern America. These results are consistent with the publication of the FAO and the litterature on the subject.\n\n\n\n\nCheck 2 : food supply by commodity\nAs a second check, we will try to reproduce the figure below published in the last FAO report FAO (2023).\n This example is interesting because FAO does not use the level of aggregation i2 (21 categories) described before but a more aggregated level (9 categories) that we propose to call i2b and store in our database as it is certainly more convenient in most of our future analysis.
