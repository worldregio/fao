We will further used another database covering the period 1963-2013 but not immediately as they are some difficulties for the harmonization of the two databases.\n\nGeometry\nWe have prepared different geometry adapted to the 188 countries or territories available in the database.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPopulation\nThe FAO has collected variables from other sources (UN, Worldbank,…) in order to get estimates of the population of territorial units for which the FBS has been collected. We eliminate the unit called China (F351) because it is the sum of four other units present in the database China Mainland (CHN), Hong Kong (HKG), Macao (MAC) and … Taïwan (TWN). This duplication of data is clearly not practical from statistical point of view. But we can easily imagine why the republic of China has obliged the FAO to proceed this way …\n\n\nJoining with `by = join_by(iso3)`\n\n\n\nPopulation 2010-2022 - Long format\n\n\niso3\nyear\npop\nname\nregion\ncontinent\n\n\n\n\nAFG\n2010\n28189.67\nAfghanistan\nSouthern Asia\nAsia\n\n\nAFG\n2011\n29249.16\nAfghanistan\nSouthern Asia\nAsia\n\n\nAFG\n2012\n30466.48\nAfghanistan\nSouthern Asia\nAsia\n\n\nAFG\n2013\n31541.21\nAfghanistan\nSouthern Asia\nAsia\n\n\nAFG\n2014\n32716.21\nAfghanistan\nSouthern Asia\nAsia\n\n\nAFG\n2015\n33753.50\nAfghanistan\nSouthern Asia\nAsia\n\n\n\n\n\nThe dataset is in long format but can easily be transformed in wide format :\n\n\n\nPopulation 2010-2022 - wide format\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\niso3\n2010\n2011\n2012\n2013\n2014\n2015\n2016\n2017\n2018\n2019\n2020\n2021\n2022\n\n\n\n\nAFG\n28189.67\n29249.16\n30466.48\n31541.21\n32716.21\n33753.50\n34636.21\n35643.42\n36686.78\n37769.50\n38972.23\n40099.46\n41128.77\n\n\nAGO\n23364.19\n24259.11\n25188.29\n26147.00\n27128.34\n28127.72\n29154.75\n30208.63\n31273.53\n32353.59\n33428.49\n34503.77\n35588.99\n\n\nALB\n2913.40\n2900.65\n2892.19\n2887.01\n2884.10\n2882.48\n2881.06\n2879.36\n2877.01\n2873.88\n2866.85\n2854.71\n2842.32\n\n\nARE\n8481.77\n8575.20\n8664.97\n8751.85\n8835.95\n8916.90\n8994.26\n9068.30\n9140.17\n9211.66\n9287.29\n9365.15\n9441.13\n\n\nARG\n41100.12\n41520.74\n41952.36\n42388.27\n42824.05\n43257.07\n43668.24\n44054.62\n44413.60\n44745.52\n45036.03\n45276.78\n45510.32\n\n\nARM\n2946.29\n2928.98\n2914.42\n2901.39\n2889.93\n2878.59\n2865.84\n2851.92\n2836.56\n2820.60\n2805.61\n2790.97\n2780.47\n\n\n\n\n\nSome missing values can be observed but only for a limited number of territorial units :\n\n\n`summarise()` has grouped output by 'iso3'.
