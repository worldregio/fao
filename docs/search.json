We will further used another database covering the period 1963-2013 but not immediately as they are some difficulties for the harmonization of the two databases.\n\nGeometry\nWe have prepared different geometry adapted to the 188 countries or territories available in the database.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPopulation\nThe FAO has collected variables from other sources (UN, Worldbank,…) in order to get estimates of the population of territorial units for which the FBS has been collected. We eliminate the unit called China (F351) because it is the sum of four other units present in the database China Mainland (CHN), Hong Kong (HKG), Macao (MAC) and … Taïwan (TWN). This duplication of data is clearly not practical from statistical point of view.

The level of consumption of Africa is at index 86 i.e -14% lower than the world average. On the contrary, Europe is at index 116 which is +16% higher than the world average.

We can reveal more important inequalities with a lowest level of 76 (-24% of world average) in Eastern Africa and an highest level of 130 (+30% of world average) in Northern America. These results are consistent with the publication of the FAO and the litterature on the subject.\n\n\n\n\nCheck 2 : food supply by commodity\nAs a second check, we will try to reproduce the figure below published in the last FAO report FAO (2023).\n This example is interesting because FAO does not use the level of aggregation i2 (21 categories) described before but a more aggregated level (9 categories) that we propose to call i2b and store in our database as it is certainly more convenient in most of our future analysis.
